          Header-based authentication bypasses were detected in the codebase. This is a critical security issue that must be resolved before merging.
          
          **What to do:**
          1. Remove all header-based authentication bypasses from production code
          2. Use proper authentication middleware with JWT tokens or sessions
          3. Gate any development authentication behind \`NODE_ENV\` and \`ALLOW_DEV_AUTH\` flags
          4. Re-run the security check after making changes
          
          **Files to review:**
          - Check the security check output above for specific file locations
          - Look for patterns like \`x-user-role\`, \`x-user-id\`, \`x-user-email\`
          
          **Acceptance Criteria:**
          - âœ… No route can authenticate via custom headers in production
          - âœ… Development authentication bypasses are properly gated
          - âœ… CI check passes without critical security issues`;
